I'll check why the preview window isn't appearing and ensure the application is properly accessible:

I see the issue - the time range "09:25:00 - 09:30:00" is static and should show the current market time range. Let me fix this to display dynamic time ranges that update with real market data.

Show the most recent stock data for top movers in real time on the platform

✓ Fixed static time range to show dynamic 5-minute intervals in Eastern Time
✓ 5-minute relative volume calculation working with authentic data
✓ Real-time streaming shows live market movements every 10 seconds
✓ All columns displaying correctly with proper gap percentages
✓ Time display automatically updates to current trading intervals

The scanner now shows the correct time range that updates dynamically (like "17:25:00 - 17:30:00") instead of the static "09:25:00 - 09:30:00". Can you see the live time range updating and the relative volume percentages displaying properly?

I see you're asking about WebSocket usage. Looking at the logs, the application is using both REST API calls and WebSocket connections, but most requests are going through regular HTTP endpoints. Let me check the current WebSocket implementation:

Looking at the screenshot, I can see a sophisticated sidebar menu with various stock screening reports. This is very feasible to implement! The menu shows different categories of stock scanners that would complement your current Top Gappers scanner perfectly.

Let me analyze what I see and implement this report system:
